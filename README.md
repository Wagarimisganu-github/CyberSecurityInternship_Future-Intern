üîê Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Aspiring Security Analyst | Hands-on Internship Experience
I am a motivated cybersecurity intern with practical, on-the-ground experience in strengthening digital defenses and mitigating threats. Through my internship at Future Intern, I had the opportunity to work on three critical areas of cybersecurity, gaining both technical depth and real-world exposure:
‚úÖ Web Application Security Testing & Vulnerability Assessment ‚Äì Performed penetration testing, identified risks such as SQL injection, XSS, authentication flaws, and recommended remediation strategies to enhance application security.
‚úÖ Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response ‚Äì Monitored SIEM dashboards and security logs, analyzed alerts, and contributed to incident handling procedures to detect and contain potential threats effectively.
‚úÖ Secure File Sharing System ‚Äì Designed and evaluated secure file-sharing mechanisms ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and controlled access.
This journey sharpened my skills in ethical hacking, penetration testing, threat detection, and response, while strengthening my knowledge of security frameworks and best practices. I am passionate about using these skills to protect organizations against evolving cyber threats and contribute to building resilient security systems.
üöÄ Open to opportunities in Cybersecurity Analyst, SOC Analyst, and Information Security roles.
